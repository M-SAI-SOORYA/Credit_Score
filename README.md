Hi Fibe! thanks for conducting the hackathon. The project is about credit score and risk analysis of various users or customers in a bank. A credit score is a three-digit number from 300 to 900 used to determine the creditworthiness of an individual. 
Credit scores are calculated by the credit bureaus in the country after taking into consideration several factors like the length of your credit history, repayment records, credit inquiries, among others.

When you apply for a credit card or a loan from a bank of NBFCs, having a higher credit score may entitle you to receive further benefits such as a higher loan amount, lower interest rate and your choice of tenure to repay the loan.
We deal by lenders and financial institutions to determine the ability of a person or a small, owner-operated business to repay. Lenders use credit scores to help decide whether to extendor deny credit as for any organization, even the slightest chance of financial risk cannot be ignored or ruled out.

1)The main of this project is to create a robust machine-learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to default on their loans, based on their historical loan repayment behaviors and transactional activities. 

We will be downloading the dataset and start the following process:
1) Exploratory Data Analysis​

2)Feature Engineering

3) Model Selection ​

4)Model Training​

5)Model Evaluation​

As we have choosen Random Forest as the model, we will be  building the model with tools sklearn, matplotlib etc.,
We made a video,  git repository, uploaded a  presentation and some snapshots.
